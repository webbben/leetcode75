# Leetcode 75 - My Solutions

Decided to challenge myself to do the leetcode 75 coding challenges, and to document my code solutions and explanations here. This is mainly to help improve my own skills, but anyone can look at my solutions for their own study purposes.

The main theory is: Ben tries to solve the problem by himself, without any aid other than basic stuff like confirming a function's use on stackoverflow, etc. Then, once I have a working solution, I do my best to further optimize it on my own. Once I've run out of ideas and need help, I check if Chat-GPT has any optimization ideas, I look at other leetcode solutions, etc.

I started this after having not done these type of coding challenges for a while, so I think my earlier solutions will be a bit rusty, and hopefully as I progress further down the list, I slowly start to improve my solutions, picking up tricks and concepts along the way.
