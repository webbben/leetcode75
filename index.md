# Leetcode 75 - My Solutions

Decided to challenge myself to do the leetcode 75 coding challenges, and to document my code solutions and explanations here. This is mainly to help improve my own skills, but anyone can look at my solutions for their own study purposes.

The main theory is: Ben tries to solve the problem by himself, without any aid other than basic stuff like confirming a function's use on stackoverflow, etc. Then, once I have a working solution, I consider how it can be optimized, and let Chat-GPT take a look. Then, I check if Chat-GPT's optimizations indeed improve the solution (in terms of runtime speed and memory).
